Just a repository and a brief description about me.

I'm an Old Wild Fox that came in contact with sivilization no so long ago.

I'm Trying my best to learn programming, while holding my Job, and taking care of my familly.(so no much time for me.)
I hope one day i write my own software, create a webpage and sell software to the world.
