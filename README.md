# hello-world
Just a repository and a brief description about me.

I'm an Old Wild Fox that came in contact with civilization not so long ago.

I'm Trying my best to learn programming, while holding my Job, and taking care of my familly.(so, not so much time for me.)
I hope one day i write my own software, create a webpage and sell software to the world.

I've been learning Python3 (Read "How to think like a computer scientist") and also html and css (Using FreeCodeCamp and the Mozilla Developers Network) probably will need to know some JavaScript. 

My first project will be create a calculator using the tkinter python package, once I have something solid, I will add some plotting capabilities to the calculator.(maybe need to use pandas python packages), It would be nice if the calculator can make currancy convertion,(should use the info from a webpage to get the current exchange rate). [Is nice to dream!!, I'll try my best to make it happen.]
